# Lambda with VPC
![[Pasted image 20240421174249.png]]
- by default, AWS lambda functions are deployed on AWS public VPC/subnet **not in your private VPC**
- ==**IMP: So your function will not have access to resources (RDS/Cache/EC2 instances) deployed on private VPC**==
- 


## How to make lambda Function connect with private VPC's resources?

- define the **VPC ID, Subnet IDs, and Security Groups**
- Lambda will create the **ENI - Elastic Network Interface** in the defined **Subnets**
- Lambda will get access to the private resources


## Example: RDS Proxy <--- IMP

- If lambda function has direct access to RDS instance
	- **multiple concurrent functions will overload the RDS**
- An RDS Proxy can be launched which the functions will connect to only.
- The proxy will be pooling the connections to the RDS instance
- **Pros:**
	- improves scalability
	- decreases failover time and preserving connections
	- improve and enforce IAM auth checks on the proxy itself
- **THE LAMBDA FUNCTION MUST BE DEPLOYED IN PRIVATE VPC AS RDS IS NEVER DEPLOYED ON PUBLIC VPC**
