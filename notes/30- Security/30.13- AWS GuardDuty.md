# AWS GuardDuty

- uses Ml to detect and discover threats in the AWS account
- just need to enable it, no additional software/agent needs to be installed
- Includes data to analyse:
	- CloudTrail Events Logs
		- Management Events
		- Data Events
	- VPC Flow Logs
	- DNS Logs
	- Activity Logs from other services (optional)
- EventBridge rules can be setup to react to the threats detected by GuardDuty
- **==IMP: ❗️ Helps against *crypto-currency* attacks or cryptocurrency mining activity on EC2 instances, it is a out-of-the-box feature==**

- **Suspending** - this stops the service to analyze the AWS data mentions above
- **disabling** - this stops the service from analyzing the AWS data and also deletes the findings and information it generated.
