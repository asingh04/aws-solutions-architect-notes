# KMS CMK Deletion

- CMKs (Customer Managed Keys) in KMS **can not be hard deleted directly**
- You have to *schedule key deletion* of a CMK key
- This **enforces a waiting period before the key is hard deleted**
- can be 7 to 30 days
- The CMK key which is *scheduled for deletion* moves into a `pending deletion` state
