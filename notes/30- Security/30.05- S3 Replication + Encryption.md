# S3 Replication and Encryption - IMP ❗️❗️

- If S3 replication is enabled for a bucket, the replication differs depending on the S3 encryption selected
- **SSE-S3**
	- The objects, encrypted by the SSE-S3 keys are replicated **by default** to the target bucket
- **SSE-C (Client Provided Keys in S3 API)**
	- Encrypted Objects can be replicated to the target bucket 
- **SSE-KMS**
	- Specify the KMS Key which will be used to encrypt objects in target bucket
	- Update the KMS key policy for this selected key
	- Create a IAM Role to ALLOW on: <- ==*to be used by the S3 Replication service*==
		- **kms:Decrypt** action on the source bucket's Key 
		- **kms:Encrypt** action on  target bucket's key
	- *This method may cause the throttling error on KMS due to key usage more than the available quota*
	- **==IMP: Multi Region Key WILL NOT HELP TO MITIGATE THIS: as S3 will consider both the keys different and encryption and decryption will still happen**
