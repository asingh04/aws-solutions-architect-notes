# KMS Key Policies

- access to KMS keys is managed **only** through Resource based policy a.k.a **Key Policy**
- 2 types of Key Policies:
- **Default KMS Key Policy**
	- Automatically created by default (*if no key policy is defined*)
	- Complete access to key to everyone in the AWS Account
- **Custom KMS Key Policy**
	- define who can access the key
	- also the actions that can be ALLOW or DENY
	- Cross-account access can also be controlled


## Copying an Encrypted EBS Snapshot Cross-Account

1. Create a snpshot using the KMS Key (**Customer Managed Key only**)
2. Attach a KMS Policy on the key to authorize cross-account access
3. Share the encrypted snapshot with the cross-account user/service
4. Decrypt the snapshot by the cross-account user/service
5. Create a copy of the snapshot using cross-account's own Key
