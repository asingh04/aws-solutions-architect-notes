# VMWare Cloud on AWS

- for client who manage their on-prem data center through **VMWare Cloud**
- And they want to extend / use AWS services as well
- **The entire VMWare Cloud infra can be hosted on AWS itself**
- For the client, the VMWare Cloud interface will still be there, **but under the hood it will AWS**
- ==helps in migration from VMWare to AWS as well==
