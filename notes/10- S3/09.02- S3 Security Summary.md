# Ensuring S3 Access controll

## User IAM 

- Control the bucket and access by users through IAM permissions and roles

## Resource Based

- **Bucket Policy** Control the bucket/object access by attaching bucket policies
- **Object Access Control List(ACL)** fine grain
- **Bucket ACL** - coarse grain control

==IMP: There should be no explicit DENY permission on user/IAM/Resource based policy==
