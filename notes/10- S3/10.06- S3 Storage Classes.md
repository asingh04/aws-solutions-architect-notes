# S3 Storage Classes

- Movement of objects between these classes can be automated using **Lifecycle rules**


==IMP: pricing = high cost of storage + low cost of retrieval==
## S3 Standard Access

- For frequently accessed data
- low latency and high throughput
## S3 Standard - Infrequent Access(IA)

- less frequently need data
- needs to be retrieved when accessed
- **IMP: ==Objects can be moved to this class only after 30 day in the SA class==**
- **Better option if access is infrequent and the content ==*CAN NOT be re-created

## S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access

- Similar to **Standard IA**
- but data is stored in only 1 AZ
- **IMP: ==Objects can be moved to this class only after 30 day in the SA class==**
- cheaper
- **Better option if access is infrequent and the content ==*can be re-created*==**



Below are classes for archiving and backing up data
==IMP: pricing = low cost of storage + high cost of retrieval==
## S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

- data can be retrieved in milliseconds

## S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

- 2 types of retrieval
	- **Expedited**- 1-5mins \$\$\$\$
	- **Standard**- 3-5 hours
	- **Bulk**- 5-12 hours (==free==)
	
## S3 Glacier Deep Archive

- longest storage of data
- 2 types of retrieval
	- **Standard**- 12 hours \$\$\$\$
	- **Bulk**- 48 hours (==free==)
## S3 Intelligent Tiering

- AWS ML model will monitor usage pattern of objects
- Will automatically place and move objects between storage classes in the bucket
