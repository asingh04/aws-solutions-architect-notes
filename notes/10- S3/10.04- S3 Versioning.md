# Versioning

- Objects can be versioned in a S3 bucket
- Bucket level setting
- Upload on same key(prefix+file name), will override the object with a new higher version

## Benefits

- Protects against accidental deletes, soft deletes objects when versioning is enabled (**delete marker**)
- Restore an object to a specific version

### IMP info on versioning

- Any object created before versioning is enabled will have  `null` as version ID
- Disabling versioning on bucket **will not delete previous versions**
- This is a *suspended* state, not a *disabled* state
