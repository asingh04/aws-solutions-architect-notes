# S3 Requester Pays

- Originally, the owner of the bucket pays for the storage and networking cost(retrieval)
- **"Requester Pays** in S3 bucket enables the networing cost is paid by the object requester insread.
- The requester must be authenticated (IAM User) and **cant be annonymous**

# MFA Delete

- **only ROOT AWS USER of the account can enable it**
- only enabled on buckets where versioning is enabled
- forces S3 to require MFA check when:
	- disabling versioning
	- hard deleting a object

# Access Logs

- All the access logs(authorised or denied) for an S3 bucket can be stored in **another S3 bucket**
- **Use Case**: The separate S3 Bucket can be used for analysis purpose
- The target S3 bucket **must be in same AWS REGION as the original bucket**
- ==IMP: **NEVER SET THE LOGGING/TARGET BUCKET SAME AS ORIGINAL BUCKET**
	- **It will cause a infinite loop of log generation and bucket may crash**

# S3 CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

-  ORIGIN = protocol +hostname+port
- If a client is making cross-origin request to the S3 bucket, **by default it will be blocked due to CORS check.**
- CORS needs to be enabled in the bucket
- Allowed origins can be all (\*) or specific origin


# S3 Pre-signed URLs

- generate pre-signed(authenticated) URL to a object using S3 Console, CLI or SDK
- Using the URL, any user can GET or PUT operations on that object
- Each URL has a expiry time

# Glacier Vault Lock (On S3 Glacier)

- a Vault Lock Policy
- object once written can not be re-written or updated

# S3 Object Lock

- Similar to Glacier lock, but at individual object level
- **Blocks object deletion up to  a certain time period**
	- in **LEGAL HOLD MODE**, time period is infinite
	- users with IAM permission can put or uplift the legal hold
- 2 modes:
	- **Compliance**
		- No object can be overwritten or deleted by **ANYONE**
	- **Governance**
		- Only users with certain IAM permissions can overwrite or permanently delete objects


# S3 Access Points
![[Pasted image 20240415175046.png]]
- Access point allows certain users to access only a subset of objects in a S3 Bucket.
- Each Access Point will have a Read Write policy specified over one or multiple objects or prefixes.
- Users who have access to that S3 Access point will get access to the limited portion of the bucket
- Each Access Point will have a DNS Name and can be either Internet Origin or VPC Origin(private)



# S3 Object Lambda
![[Pasted image 20240415175622.png]]
- helps to modify objects before being retrieved by a user
- a **S3 Object Lambda Access Point** is used, which used a **S3 Access Point** to retrieve the object and trigger a lambda function with it
- **Use Case:**
	- Redact sensitive info from object
	- Enrich data in the object for retrieval
	-
