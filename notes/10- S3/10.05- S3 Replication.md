# Replication

- ==IMP: **Versioning must be enabled in source and target buckets for replication**
- Both buckets can be in **different AWS account as well**
- Replication is always **asynchronous**
- ==IMP: **S3 Must have proper IAM permissions for replications**==
- ==IMP: **By default delete markers are not replicated, can be enabled**
- ==IMP: **hard deletes are not replicated**==
- 2 types of S3 Replication
	- CRR - Cross Region Replication
	- SRR - Same Region Replication

## Use cases:

- **CRR**
	- data compliance
	- lower latency access to different region user
	- replication across multiple/different AWS account
- **SRR**
	- log aggregation
	- replication between production and test environment
