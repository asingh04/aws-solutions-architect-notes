- Any activity, mostly create/update/delete/replication, in a S3 bucket generates a event
- S3 events can be consumed by:
	- lambda function
	- SNS topic
	- SQS queue
- Filtering of event based on objects' name is also possible.

## IAM permissions for consuming S3 Events

- The **==Resource Policy==** **must be attached to the consumer**
- The S3 bucket ARN should be in the Resource Policy's `Principal` and `Conditions` to provide events information to trigger the message or function execution
	- **Lambda** - Lambda Rosource Plicy
	- **SQS**- SQS Resource Policy
	- **SNS** - SNS Resource Policy
