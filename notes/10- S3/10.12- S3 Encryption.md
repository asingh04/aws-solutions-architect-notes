# S3 Encryption

- S3 encrypts the actual file / content of the objects
- ***S3 never encrypts the metadata associated with the object***
- Objects in S3 bucket can be encrypted through 4 methods:

## Server Side Encryption (SSE)

- **SSE-S3**
	- S3 managed keys are used to encrypt objects
	- Customer has no control over the key
	- Encryption algo AES-256
	- Header `x-amz-service-sideencryption: AES-256` must be set when creating objects
	- Each object is encrypted with different key by S3
	- **Enabled by default for new buckets and objects**
	- 
- **SSE-KMS**
	- AWS Key Management Service - KMS service managed keys are used
	- Header `x-amz-service-sideencryption: "aws:kms"` must be set when creating objects
	- **Pros**
		- **Customer can control the key**
		- **Key usage is logged in Audit Trail**
	- **Cons** ==**(SUPER IMP)**==
		- Dependency on KMS APIs and limits
		- **Upload and Download on S3 buckets calls `GenerateDataKey` and `Decrypt` APIs of KMS**
		- **KMS has limited quotas for these APIs**
		- **Post the breach of this limit, throttling occuers**
- **SSE-C**
	- Customer provided keys are used to encrypt& decrypt objects
	- But the encryption is still done by S3
	- AWS never stores the key
	- The key must be provide in each HTTPS request when creating or fetching objects


## Client Side Encryption

- Customer is responsible for encrypting and decrypting the objects themselves
- The encryption and decryption is done by AWS CLI/SDK - S3 APIs

## Encryption in-flight

- S3 supports SSL / TLS 
- S3 provides both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints for the bucket and objects

### Forcing HTTPS (IMP)

- Use **bucket policy**'s **DENY** permission when HTTP is used
