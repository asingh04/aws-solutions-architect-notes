# Comparing Different Databases available on AWS

- The exam gives certain scenarios and constraints
- and then it asks you to select the correct DB option for the solution

# RDS

- need to provision instance size, volume type and size
- auto-scaling can be enabled
- Read Replicas and MultiAZs
- backups options provided, **point in time restore capability**

# Aurora

- PostgreSQL and MySQL
- best for cloud support on AWS
- 6 ReadReplicas across 3 AZs
- Good to know
	- **Aurora Serverless** - for unpredictable workload and no capacity management/provisioning
	- **Aurora Global**- upto 16 ReadReplicas in each region for low latency in replication

# ElasticCache

- managed Redis/Mem-cache service
- supports clustering(redis), multi-AZ, read replicas, sharding
- Backups and Point in time restore

# DynamoDB

- serverless tables
- has TTL feature in row level
- Multi AZ by default, Read and write throughput are decoupled
- DAX can be used to increase read throughput and lower latency
- DynamoDB streams can be used to input into Lambda / KDS

# S3

- blob storage for objects(files with some key value pairs)

# DocumentDB

- fully managed service for MongoDB (NoSQL db)
- same deployment concept as Aurora

# Neptune

- fully managed graph database
- eg: social network

# Keyspaces

- fully managed service for Apache Cassandra
- data is replicated 3 times across AZs
- Has provision modes similar to DynamoDB

# QLDB

- Quantum Ledger Database
- recording financial transactions
- can be used to record history of changes made on a application
- **immutable** nothing can be removed or modified

# TimeStream

- fully managed time series database
- scales up and down automatically
-
