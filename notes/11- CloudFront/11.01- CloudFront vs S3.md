# S3 Buckets as Origin for CloudFront
- distributing static files
- CF secures S3 origin using **OAC**- Origin Access Control ❗️
- CF can acts as a ingress to send traffic to S3 bucket

## IMP: CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication ❗️❗️

- **CloudFront**
	- Used global edge network
	- Data is cached on edge servers for TTL time period
	- **BEST CHOICE for ==static== content that needs to be available anywhere**
- **S3 Cross Region Replication**
	- Must be setup for each region where you need content
	- Updates are in NRT Near Real Time
	- Read only
	- **BEST CHOICE for dynamic content that needs to be available in certain regions quickly**
