# CloudFront

- AWS CDN service
- Helps reduce latency for users
- Protects your application against DDoS attack
## Custom Origin

- ALB
- EC2
- S3 Website
- HTTP enable backed

# CloudFront Field Level Encryption

- field level encryption on post request body at edge locations
- helps to protect sensitive data
- Only the end application can decrypt
- only a subset of fields can be specified to be encrypted

# S3 Buckets as Origin for CloudFront
- distributing static files
- CF secures S3 origin using **OAC**- Origin Access Control ❗️
- CF can acts as a ingress to send traffic to S3 bucket

## IMP: CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication ❗️❗️

- **CloudFront**
	- Used global edge network
	- Data is cached on edge servers for TTL time period
	- **BEST CHOICE for ==static== content that needs to be available anywhere**
- **S3 Cross Region Replication**
	- Must be setup for each region where you need content
	- Updates are in NRT Near Real Time
	- Read only
	- **BEST CHOICE for dynamic content that needs to be available in certain regions quickly**


## CloudFront + S3

- when using S3 (static files or static website) as origin for your CF distribution,
- Create a special Amazon CloudFront user called an **origin access identity (OAI)** and associate it with your distribution.
- Configure your Amazon S3 bucket permissions so that **only Amazon CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your bucket** and serve them to your users. 
- **This makes sure that users can’t use a direct URL to the Amazon S3 bucket to access a file there.**
