# Unicast IP vs Anycast IP

- **Unicast IP**
	- One server holds only 1 IP address
- **Anycast IP**
	- All servers hold the same IP address  
	-  client is redirected to the nearest server


# AWS Global Accelerator

- uses the concept of Anycast IP
- The  traffic from different location/region is re-directed to the origin via AWS's own private network
	- **Not through public internet**
	- **Avoid multiple hops**
- This reduces latency a lot
- Works with public or private:
	- Elastic IP
	- ALB
	- EC2 Instances
- Improves performance a lot
- Provides health checks
- Provides regional failover
