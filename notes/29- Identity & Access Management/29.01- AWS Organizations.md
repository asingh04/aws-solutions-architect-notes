# AWS Organizations

- helps to **manage multiple AWS accounts**
- There will be a **1 AWS Account called the MAIN ACCOUNT**
	- this account will be managing all the other accounts
- Other AWS accounts will be called **Member Accounts**
	- 1 member account will always be part of **only 1** MAIN Account/Organization.
- **Pros:**
	- Consolidated billing of all the member accounts into the single main account
		- helps to mitigate sudden price/billing spikes in AWS Accounts
	- price discounts on bills due to aggregated heavy usage
	- reserved instances/resources can be shared among the members
	- sends logs to a central account
	- **Implement SCPs** <-- **==IMP==**


## Root Organization Unit (OU)
![[Pasted image 20240426120219.png]]
- logical unit which includes a Main Account and all the members accounts
- can also contain a sub-OU




## SCP - Service Control Policy

- IAM policy that can be applied to a OU or Account
- helps to restrict or authorize users in the OU/Account on what they can do
- **SCP never be applicable to the Root/Management Account**
- => **Management account will ALWAYS HAVE FULL ADMIN RIGHTS**
- **THE SCP Policies can be inherited by sub-OUs and the account within them**

### SCP Strategies

- **AllowList**:
	- explicitly allow individual activities only
- **Block List**:
	- firstly allow all activities for a service
	- then DENY some individual activities
