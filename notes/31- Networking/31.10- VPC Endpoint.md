# VPC Endpoint a.k.a AWS Private Link

- Helps to access resources/AWS services **privately** ie.==without routing traffic through open internet (using NATGW + IGW)
- Resources deployed in VPC (public or private) can directly access the AWS services through AWS' private network instead
- **it is deployed on VPC level**
