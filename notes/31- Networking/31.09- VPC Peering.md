# VPC Peering

- **VPC Peering:**
	- helps to privately connect 2 different VPCs using AWS' internal network
- **IMP ❗️: ==THE CIDR BLOCKS OF THE VPCs MUST NOT OVERLAP==**
- **IMP ❗️❗️:==The ROUTE TABLE IN THE VPCs' SUBNETS must be updated to communicate to other VPC's resources==**
	- => In the VPC A (x.x.x.x/a) route table:
		- y.y.y.y/b ------> the provisioned VPC Peering 
	- => In the VPC B (y.y.y.y/b) route table:
		- x.x.x.x/a ------> the provisioned VPC Peering
- **Non-transitive**
	- => for connecting multiple VPCs, ==**the VPC Peering between each pair must be setup explicitly**==
- **Cross Account Peering** is supported as well
- Once VPC Peering is setup, the SGs from the other VPC can be referenced
