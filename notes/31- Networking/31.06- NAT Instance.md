# NAT (network Address Translation) Instance
![imag](Pasted_image_20240430171339.png)
- allows EC2 instance **deployed in private instance** to be access the internet
	- => Since it is an EC2 Instance in Public Subnet, **NAT Instance can act as a Bastion Instance as well**
- **NAT instance must be deployed in "public subnet"**
- **==IMP ❗️ EC2 instance setting: *Source/Destination Check* ❌ must be disabled==****
	- => bcoz NAT Instance re-writes the src and destination IP addresses of the network packets
	- => **NAT instance supports Port-forwarding as well**
- **==IMP ❗️ The NAT Instance must have an elastic IP attached to it==**

- 
- The route table must be configured to allow traffic from EC2 instance to internet
- Also the SG on the NAt Instance must be managed and applied to help in the traffic

## Route Table changes

 - in the separate route table for "private subnet"
 - Add a rule:
	 - 0.0.0.0/0 (all traffic) -----> NAT Instance
	-
