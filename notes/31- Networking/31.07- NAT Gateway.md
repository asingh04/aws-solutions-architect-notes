# NAT Gateway

- similar to IGW
- fully AWS managed, highly available and redundant
- **deployed on specified AZ only (❌ not at VPC / region level)**
	- => **==❗️ it AWLAYS should be deployed on the Public Subnet==**
- needs a Elastic IP
- *helps internet access to the EC2 Instances deployed in private subnet*
- **Requires a IGW as well to function**
	- Traffic path
		- Ec2 Instance => NATGW => IGW => Internet
- Better to create multiple NATGW in multi AZ for higher availability

## Route Table CHanges:

- The route table for the "private subnet" should have the rule:
	- 0.0.0.0/0(all traffic) ----> NATGW
-
