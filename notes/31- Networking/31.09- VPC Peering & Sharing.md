# VPC Peering

- **VPC Peering:**
	- helps to privately connect 2 different VPCs using AWS' internal network
- **IMP ❗️: ==THE CIDR BLOCKS OF THE VPCs MUST NOT OVERLAP==**
- **IMP ❗️❗️:==The ROUTE TABLE IN THE VPCs' SUBNETS must be updated to communicate to other VPC's resources==**
	- => In the VPC A (x.x.x.x/a) route table:
		- y.y.y.y/b ------> the provisioned VPC Peering 
	- => In the VPC B (y.y.y.y/b) route table:
		- x.x.x.x/a ------> the provisioned VPC Peering
- **Non-transitive**
	- => for connecting multiple VPCs, ==**the VPC Peering between each pair must be setup explicitly**==
- **Cross Account Peering** is supported as well
- Once VPC Peering is setup, the SGs from the other VPC can be referenced



# VPC Sharing

- allows **multiple AWS accounts** to create their application resources, in **a single shared, centrally-managed virtual private clouds (VPCs)**. 
- account that owns the VPC (owner) **shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants)** that belong to the same organization
- After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them. 
- *Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.*
