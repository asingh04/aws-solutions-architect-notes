# IPv6 in VPCs

- you can enable IPv6 support in a VPC
	- => such combined support for IPv4 and IPv6 is called **Dual Stack Support**
- Resources provioned in this mode, will be given:
	- **private IPv4 address**
	- **public IPv6 address**
- They can communicate using either IP address using the IGW


## IPv6 Troubleshooting - unable to provision a EC2 instance

- **IPv4 CAN NOT BE DISABLED in an VPC**
- When provisioning a EC2 instance, if you get an error:
	- => ==It must be bcoz no IPv4 address is left to assign to the instance==
	- IPv6 addresses are plenty 
- **Solution:**
	- => Create a new CIDR block in the VPC/subnet


## Egress Only Internet Gateway (IPv6 Only)
![[Pasted image 20240504221123.png]]
- can be used only when IPv6 is enabled
- **Allows outbound connections from instances to internet, but any entity outside in the internet can not initiate connection**
	- => *inbound is allowed, but only when connection is initiated by the resource in VPC*
- **==IMP ❗️Route tables must be configured for this(just like for NATGW)==**
