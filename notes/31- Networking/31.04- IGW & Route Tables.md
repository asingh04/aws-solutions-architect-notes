# Internet GateWay - IGW

- helps resources in a VPC to connect to internet
	- **Also needs route tables configured as well**
- highly available and redundant
- **must be provisioned separately from VPC/subnet**
- **==IMP: ❗️ only 1 IGW can be provisioned in a VPC==** <---IMP


# Route Table

- Hold the rules/route info for the VPC
- A route can needs to be **explicitly associated with subnets for which it will work for**


## How to make a "Public Subnet"?

- create a VPC and the subnet
- Create IGW and link it to the VPC
- Create a Route table and explicitly associate it with the subnet
- By default the only rule in route table will be:
	- x.x.x.x/a(the VPC CIDR block) ----> `Local`
- Add a new rule in the route table:
	- 0.0.0.0/0(all traffic) ---> `IGW`  ✅
- The resources in the "public subnet" will be accessible and have access to internet

Example:

### Default Routing Table
10.0.0.0/16  ------------> Local


### Public Routing Table
10.0.0.0/16  ------------> Local
0.0.0.0/0 -------------> IGW (Internet Gateway)
