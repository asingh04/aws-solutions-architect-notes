# Virtual Private Cloud

- each region can have multiple VPCs (max 5)
- Max 5 CIDR blocks can be defined in a VPC
- **Each CIDR block can be:**
	- min size 16 IP Addresses (x.x.x.x/28)
	- MAX size 65536 IP Addresses (x.x.x.x/16)
- **==IMP ❗️: Since VPC are private, only the Private IPs (10.0.0.0/x)/(172.16.0.0/x)/(192.168.0.0/x) are allowed for CIDR blocks!**
- **==IMP ❗️❗️ CIDR ranges of a VPC should NOT OVERLAP with CIDR block of another VPC (*not a good practice)***


# Subnets

- **Subnet:** sub-range of the IPS address from a VPC
- **AWS reserves 5 IP addresses from each subnet**
	- first 4, and
	- last IP
- These IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to any resource.
- **EG:** if the Subnet CIDR is 10.0.0.0/24, then the 5 reserved IPs are:
	- **10.0.0.0**: Network Address
	- **10.0.0.1**: Reserved for VPC router
	- **10.0.0.2**: reserved for AWS-provided DNS
	- **10.0.0.3**: reserved for future use
	- **10.0.0.255**(last IP in CIDR): network broadcast IP
- **==IMP: ❗️ Exam always ask question on what should be the CIDR block if you need to assign *n* IP addresses to resource in a subnet**
	- eg: if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instance:
		- => you can not select 10.x.x.x/27 CIDR block
			- 32 IP Addresses, out which (32-5=)27 IP addresses will 
		- => you will need a 10.x.x.x/26 CIDR block
			-  => 64 IP Addresses, out of which 59 will be available
