# NACL - Network Access Control List

- firewall like, Stateless service
	- both inbound and outbound packet is checked
- checks inbound or outbound traffic if it is ALLOWED or DENIED
- **deployed for each subnet, i.e subnet level check**
	- => ==New subnets created will have the default NACL==
- For inbound, NACL rules are checked before the SG rules 
- For outbound, SG rules are checked before the NACL rules


## NACL Rule

- each rule **has a priority number, lower the number higher the priority**
	- 1 has more priority over 345
- The rule will higher priority will be evaluated first
- The first rule which is matched will be implemented
- **The last rule will have * as priority number, and is evaluated last if no rule matches.**
	- => *This rule DENY any inbound and outbound traffic*
- AWS recommends adding rules in increments of 100s
	- => helps in adding new rules in between the existing rules

## Default NACL <-- IMP ❗️

- **Accepts everything inbound and outbound** with the subnet it is associated with.
- DO NOT MODIFY THE DEFAULT NACL, create a new NACL instead of changes

# Security Group

- Stateful service
	- if a inbound rule is met, it doesnt check the outbound rule, vice versa
- SG only have ALLOW rules



# Ephemeral Port

- **Ephemeral Port** => The client's port which is used to receive response from a server
- Different OS uses different port ranges
- ![[Pasted image 20240430180944.png]]
- **==IMP: ❗️ NACL must include inbound and outbound rules to allow traffic on these ephemeral ports as well.** 
	- **THE PORT RANGE FROM THESE OS CAN BE USED**
