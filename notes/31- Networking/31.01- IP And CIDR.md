# IP and CIDR

## CIDR

- **BASE IP** - First part of the CIDR block defined the value of the first n bits which are common
- **Subnet Mask** - The value at the end defines number *n* which is the no of bit that will be fixed, rest (32-n) bits will vary
- x.x.x.x/32 
	- all first 32 bits are common
	- => only 1 IP address
- x.x.x.x/30 
	- only first 30 bits are common
	- => only 4 IP addresses available
- x.x.x.x/0 
	- no starting bits are commoin
	- => all 2<sup>32</sup> IP Addresses for 
- x.x.x.x/26 => only 64 IP address
- x.x.x.x/16 => only 65536 IP Addresses
-
