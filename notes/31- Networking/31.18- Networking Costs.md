# Networking Cost in AWS

- Always prefer to use **private IPs** of instances to communicate
	- => usage of private IP costs less or **free**
	- Performance would be better too bcoz it uses AWS' internal network
- Keep resource that need to communicate more and more in the **same AZ**
	- **HOWEVER,  this compromises the High Availability if the AZ is down**


- **Egress Traffic (AWS to Internet)** is costly
	- => it would be better to minimize the data transfer to outside AWS env.
	- eg: **Move the data consuming application to AWS instead**
- **Ingress Traffic (Internet to AWS)** is free


## DX Costing

- For **Egress Traffic Cost**, from VPC to DX Location, is **lower when the VPC  and DX Location are in same Region**
