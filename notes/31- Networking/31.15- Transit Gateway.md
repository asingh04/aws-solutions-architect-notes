	- => can be done through **Route Tables**
- **Supports IP multicast** <--- **==IMP for exam❗️ **
	- => if **IP multicast appears, answer is Transit Gateway**


## Transit Gateway + Site-to-Site VPN (ECMP)

- **ECMP Routing**= Equal Cost Multi-Path Routing
	- => the traffic packet is sent to multiple best paths 
- Create and Connect multiple Site-to-Site VPN to the Transit Gateway
- **Helps increasing the total bandwidth of the Site-to-Site Connection**
