## Spot Requests
To get EC2 Spot Instances, you need to submit a Spot Request
- Once the spot instances can be provisioned, based on user price, the instances are assigned.
- 2 types of requests:
	- One time
	- Persistent
- Once the spot instances are to be stoped or terminated, 
	- **For one time** it is over
	- **For Persistent Type**: the spot request is still valid and once again if the price conditions are met, the sport instances will be provisions again
- To terminate a spot instance, the <u>spot request must be terminated first</u>, then the spot instances be deleted as well



## Spot Fleets
Spot fleets = set of spot instances + set of on-demand instances

- define multiple launch pools: combo of instance type, OS, AZ
- SF will try to launch spot instances from a launch pool meeting the price Constraint 
- Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
	1. **lowestPrice**
		- pool with the lowest price is launched
		- short workload + cost optimised
	 2. **diversified**
		 - distributed across all pools
		 - long workload and availability
	3. **capacity Optimised**
		- pool with optimal capacity for number of instances
	4. **Price capacity optimised**
		- pools with highest capacity available then select the pool with lowest price
