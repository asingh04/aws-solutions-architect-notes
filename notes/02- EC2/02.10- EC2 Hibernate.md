Generally, the EC2 states:

- **Stop** - data on disk (EBS) is kept intact
- **Terminate** - the EBS volume (root) is terminated too, if selected to be destroyed


 In **Hibernate** state, the application/instance stops, but
- the in-memory(RAM) is preserved, the content is written to the root EBS volume.
- **the EBS (root) will be an dmust be encrypted** <--- IMP
- the OS is not stopped or restarted
- so on EC2 restart, the application is re-boot time is faster

<u>Use Case</u>: 
- long running processes
- you want to save RAM
- for services / applications that takes time to boot up

<u>IMP</u>: EC2 instance can't remain in HIBERNATE mode for more than 60 days.
