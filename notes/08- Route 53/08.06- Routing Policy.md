# Routing Policy

*Routing actually means how to resolve a domain/hostname query into a IP address*


There are multiple types:


## Simple Routing

- resolves to a single resource/ip address
- **IF multiple values are specified**, ***a random one is selected***
- **IF AWS ALIAS is specified**, ***only 1 resource is allowed***
- ==**IMP** NO Health Checks ‚ùå==
