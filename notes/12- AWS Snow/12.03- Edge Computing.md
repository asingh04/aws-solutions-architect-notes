# Edge Computing Using Snow Family

- Snow devices can be used to process data at the edge location where it is being produced (eg mines, shipyards, airports, etc)
	- where space constraints are too high
	- no or low internet connectivity
	- hard to keep computing resources
- **Use Case:**
	- Pre-process data before sending it to cloud
	- ML at edge location


## SnowCone & SnowCone SSD

## SnowBall Edge



- All Snow family devices for Edge COmputing can run EC2 instances and lambda functions
