# Data Migration using Snow Family

- Data transfer to/from AWS over network is challenging
	- limited connectivity
	- low bandwidth
	- high time to transfer
- **IMP RULE: If data migration over network is taking over more than a week time, USE AWS SNOW FAMILY**

## SnowBall Edge

- for transferring **TBs and PBs** of data
- provides block storage as in S3 Bucket
- **Use Case:**
	- Data to cloud migration
	- DC Shutdown

## SnowCone

- small portable device version of SnowBall
- 2 types: 8TB (HDD) and 14TB(SSD)
- **Use Case**:
	- Where space and physical restriction limits large size of snowball edge
	- lower amount of data in (TBs) only
- **IMP: SnowCone can either be sent back to AWS or connected to internet & use AWS DataSync to transfer data back to AWS.** 

## SnowMobile

- a literal truck
- for data in volume in EBs (1EB = 1000 PBs)
