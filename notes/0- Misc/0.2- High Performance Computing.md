# High performance Computing (HPC)

- perfect for cloud computing:
- requires very high no of resources to be utilized

## EC2 Instances Cluster Mode

- A fleet of EC2 instances can be provisioned and run in lcuster mode
	- => they are run in same AZ and rack
	- provide better network and communication for HPC
- 
## EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)  


- Provides **Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency network**

- **Option 1**: 
	- **
	** up to 100 Gbps
	
- **Option 2:**
	- Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps â€“ LEGACY

## Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)

- More Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
    
- **Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads**
	- => Distributed Computation
    
- Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
    
- Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

## AWS Batch

- AWS service to execute parallel jobs
- it automatically provisions the EC2 instance required, and schedules the jobs

## AWS ParallelCluster

- Open source tool to execute HPC jobs in AWS
- Automate creation of resources, VPCs, subnets, SGs, etc
- **Ability to use Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) on EC2 clusters for faster performance**
