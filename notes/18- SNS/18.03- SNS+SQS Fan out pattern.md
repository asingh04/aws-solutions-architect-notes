# Fan-Out Pattern using SNS and SQS

![[Pasted image 20240418175535.png]]
- SNS and SQS can combine to form a fan-out pattern.
- **Publisher** will push a message into a SNS Topic
- SNS TOpic will push the message to multiple SQS queue, which were added as subscriber.
- Each SQS queue will have consumer which will process the message on it own independently from other queues or consumers
-  SQS provides:
	- data persistence, retry logic (DLQ config), etc for each consuming service
- SNS provides:
	- ability to manage subscribers, add new or remove existing old ones

==**IMP==
- Make sure the **SQS Access Policy/Resource Policy allows the SNS topic to publish message into the queue**
