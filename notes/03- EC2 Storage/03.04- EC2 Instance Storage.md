- EBS are network drive, and have latency
- <u> Use the Instance Storage of the EC2 instance, for better performance</u>
- These are Hardware -based drives
- **unlike EBS, instance store can not be detached from existing EC2 instance and attached to a new one**
	- => *The data will be destroyed in the instance store*

**PROS:**
- **BEST and cheapest IOPS performance** comapred to io1/io2 EBS

**CONS**:
- they are ephemeral storage, i.e the data will be lost when EC2 instance is terminated
- risk for data loss if hardware fails
- you have to take responsibility for backup and replication if needed

**USE CASES:**
- Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
-
