- Encryption can be enable in EBS:
	- data at rest in the volume
	- data in flight, i.e moving between the instance and volume
	- EBS snapshots
	- All volumes created from the snapshot

- Encryption and decryptions are done by EBS automaticaly
- Minimal impact on latency
- snapshot created from un-encrypted volume will be un-encrypted
- snapshot created from encrypted volume will be encrypted.

- Volume created from encrypted snapshot will be encrypted always
- Volume created from unencrypted snapshot can be un-encrypted or encrypted.


IMP ---> **Encrypt an unencrypted EBS Volume**
- create a snapshot from the unencrypted EBS volume
- encrypt the snapshot, by creating a copy
- create a new volume from the snapshot
- the volume created is now encrypted
