# Delete on Termination for EBS Instance

- when creating EBS volumes, you can select "Delete on Termination" option
- This ensures when the attached EC2 instance is terminated, the EBS volumes get deleted as well.
- **IMP**: <u> BY DEFAULT - only the root EBS volumes has this option checked, other attached EBS volumes have this as unchecked</u>**
- **For root EBS volume already attached, you can setÂ `DeleteOnTermination` to False using the command line.**
