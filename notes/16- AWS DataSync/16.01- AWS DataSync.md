	- on-prem services to AWS services
		- **require datasync agent**
	- AWS service to AWS service
- Can sync data to 
	- **S3** (**ANY STORAGE CLASS DIRECTLY**) <--- IMP
	- EFS
	- FSx
- And replication/synch tasks can be scheduled hourly/daily/weekly basis
- ==**IMP: DataSync can preserve the file permissions and metadata EVEN AFTER SYNC==**
	- **ITS THE ONLY SERVICE TO DO SO**
