# KMS Multi-Region Keys

- Keys are generally created in one region, and usable only in that particular region by default
- **Keys can be replicated to multiple different regions as well**
- **the Key ID will remain the same**
- **==Each replicated Key is managed independently with its own key policy==** <-- IMP
- 

## Use Cases:

- encrypt in one region and decrypt in another
- helps avoid cross-region KMS API calls
- Helps in **DynamoDB Global Tables, Aurora Global**


## Multi Region Keys + DynamoDB Global Tables

- ***DynamoDB allows encryption of only a subset of attributes as well***
- An application in Region 1 can create a dynamoDB table item, which encrypts some attributes using the KMS key
- If the Key is Multi-Region Type, this key will be replicated in the Region 2 as well
- The item is replicated to Region 2 as well, along with the encrypted attributes
- An application in Region 2 which wants to access the item, can use the multi-region key to decrypt and get the complete item
- ***This will help to decrypt the data in region 2 with lower latency***

- *same mechanism as with DynamoDB Global Tables*
