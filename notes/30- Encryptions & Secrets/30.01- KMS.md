# Keys Management System - KMS

- manages the encryption keys for us
- Access Control over the keys is done by **IAM Authentication**
- Key usage can be audited by **CloudTrail** <--- **==IMP==**
- Integrated with lots of AWS services: EBS, S3, SQS, RDS, etc
- Can also carry out encryption and decryption using those keys
	- done using API or SDK
- KMS Key is also known as Customer Master Key (CMK)


## KMS Keys Types

- **Symmetric (AES-256)**
	- single key for encryption and decryption of data
	- any AWS service with integrated with KMS uses **Symmetric Keys**
	- Keys are never exposed to anyone, but usable through AWS API/SDK/CLI
- **Asymmetric Keys (RSA / ECC)**
	- pair of Public Key and Private key
	- useful for sign/verify or secret communication etc
	- **public key is downloadable, but not the private key**
	- **Use Case:**
		- **For applications outside of AWS eco system, they can encrypt data using public key and send it to the AWS service**
