# Message Visibility Timeout

- When a consumer receives a message, that message is invisible for other consumers **for the next  "Message Visibility Timeout" time period**
- If the first consumer after receiving the message doesnt deletes the message from the SQS queue within this timeout value
	- The message will again be visible to any of the other consumers on next polling.
- ==**IMP: if a consumer needs more time to process the message**
	- **the consumer can change the visibility timeout value,*using ChangeMessageVisibilty API***


# Long Polling

- Every poll on the Queue(API call to SQS) incurs some cost 
- With each poll a consumer can wait a bit loneger to get new messages
- **WaitTimeSeconds** can be set to *20s* <-- This is called **Long Polling**
	- On SQS queue level
	- on consumer API call level
