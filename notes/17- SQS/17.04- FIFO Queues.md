# FIFO - First IN First Out

- Ordering of messages is guaranteed
	- Consumers receive messages in order
- Limited throughput compared to Standard SQS queue
- Messages are sent **Exactly Once**
- **IMP: ==FIFO queue has a limited throughput of 3000 messages per second with batching or 300 messages per sec without matching==**
