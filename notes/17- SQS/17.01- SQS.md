# Simple Queue Service (SQS)

- fully managed message queuing service by AWS
- There can be multiple  producers and multiple consumers consuming from same queue
- **decouples the producers and consumers**
- Unlimited number of throughput and number of messages in queue
- 2 types:
	- Standard queue
	- FIFO queue
- Imp attributes:
	- 4 days message retention in Queue, max 14 days
	- low latency (<10ms between publish and receive)
	- **Max message size is 256kB**
		- for more, **use S3: upload message on S3 and push S3 link in the queue**


## SQS Standard Queue

- Standard Queue may sometime deliver duplicate messages to consumers
	- this is called **Atleast Once Delivery**
- Messages can be **in random order** for consumers

### Consumers of Standard Queue

- Can be any EC2 instance, Lambda function, any other service
- Each consumer has to poll the queue for new messages it can receive
	- can poll for max 10msg at a time
- Post processing the message, the consumer **has to notify the SQS queue to delete the message from the queue**
	- if not, the message will be made available to another consumer after sometimes.
	- 
- ==**IMP: Increasing the number of consumers(like no of EC2 instances) increases the throughput of the system and queue**


# IMP
### SQS Queue with ASG on EC2 instances can scale up or down the instances based on queue metrics(no of messages in queue)

- this will maintain the high throughput of the system dynamically
