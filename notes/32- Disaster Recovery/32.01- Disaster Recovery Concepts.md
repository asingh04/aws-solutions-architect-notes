# Disaster Recovery(DR) Concepts

- disaster is any situation which negatively impacts business or application operations
- mitigating from such disaster is **Disaster Recovery**

## Types of DR in AWS

- **On-Prem recovery**
	- recovery is done on client's on-prem infra
	- expensive
- **Hybrid recovery**
	- The on-prem infra is moved to cloud for DR
- **Cloud Recovery**
	- the recovery involves moving from region A to region B in cloud


## RPO and RTO
![[Pasted image 20240505165755.png]]
- **RPO: Recovery Point Objective**
	- defines how frequently backups of the system / infra is made
	- **higher frequency of RPO** => ==less time gap between last backup and disaster==
		- **Less time gap b/w backup and disaster**
			- => ==lesses data loss==
- **RTO: Recovery Time Objective**
	- defines the time needed to mitigate the disaster since it's occurrence
	- **lower RTO**
		- => ==less time the service / application downtime==


## DR Strategies in AWS

The following strategies are in order of 
**decreasing RPO ⬇ & RTO ⬇ **

1. **Backup and Restore**
2. **Pilot Light**
3. **Warm Standby**
4. **Hot Site / Multi Site Approach**
