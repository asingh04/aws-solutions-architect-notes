# Backups in RDS

- **Automated Backups**
	- Frequent DB backup in a defined backup window
	- Transactions logs are backed up every 5 minutes
	- ==all this enabled time backtracking of DB==
	- **IMP**: retention period can be 1 to 35 days only, **can be disabled by setting it to 0**
	- 
- **Manual DB Snapshots**
	- Snapshot/backup is created manually by user
	- Retention period IS INFINITE!

**IMP FOR EXAM**

- When a RDS is stopped (not terminated), you still have to pay for storage
- **==TAKE A SNAPSHOT INSTEAD AND STORE IS SOMEWHERE, THEN TERMINATE THE RDS INSTANCE==**
- This will help to avoid cost
