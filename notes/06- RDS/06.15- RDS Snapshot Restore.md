# Restoring a RDS/Aurora DB using Snapshot

- A RDS backup/snapshot can be restored to create a new instance

**IMP for EXAM**
- Restore a MySQL RDS from S3
	- Create a snapshot of a on-prem MySQL DB
	- Store it on ANS S3
	- Create a MySQL RDS instance from the snapshot

- Restore a MySQL Aurora from S3
	- Create a snapshot of the on-prem DB ==using Percona XtraBackup tool== <--- required tool
	- Store the snapshot in S3
	- Create a MySQL Aurora instance from the snapshot


## Aurora Database Cloning

- clone a existing DB cluster to create a new cluster
- **FASTER THAN SNAPSHOT-AND-RESTORE**
- Uses ==copy on write== protocol
	- The new instance/cluster uses same storage volume as the existing one
	- When changes are made into the new DB, a separate volume is allocated for hold the changes from the new DB
- **cheaper**
