# Aurora Replicas Auto Scaling

- The Read Replicas can auto scale automatically
- The reader endpoint will cover newly created replicas and load balance among them
- These replicas share common storage with the write replica as well.
- Also the read replicas will be served by a separate but common Reader endpoint
