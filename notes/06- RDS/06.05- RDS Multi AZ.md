# Multi AZ (disaster recovery)

- like a **SLAVE instance** or **STANDBY** instance
- A replica of your RDS instance can be created cross AZ (same region)
- Uses **SYNC** replication
- ==Automatic Failover==
	- If main DB is down, AWS will automatically switch to Slave DB
	- Application **no need to update DB url** to connect

**IMP NOTE**
==Read Replica can be setup in multi AZ for Disaster Recovery==
