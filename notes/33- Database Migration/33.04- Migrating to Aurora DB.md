# Migrating MySQL/PostgreSQL to Aurora (IMP FOR EXAM)


## RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL to Aurora

- **Option 1**
	- Take DB snapshot for the RDS instance
	- Restore the snapshot as a Aurora instance
	- *may incur downtime on source DB*
	- *most cost effective solution*
- **Option 2**
	- create a Aurora Read replica over the source
	- the replication will be async
	- when the replication is done, promote the replica as master
	- *takes time and cost*


## External/On-prem MySQL/PostgreQL to Aurora

- **Option 1**
	- use **Percona XtraBackup** to create a backup file in S3
	- import this backup file directly from S3 by Aurora
- **Option 2** (only for MySQL)
	- provision the Aurora MySQL instance
	- use the `mysqldump` utility to backup data directly into the Aurora MySQL

## ❗️ BEST OPTION IF BOTH SOURCE AND TARGET (Aurora) ARE RUNNING

- use **DMS**
