# Schema Conversion Tool

- if the source and target DBs are not of same DB engine
	- **Schema conversion will be required**
- **SCT will convert the schema from Source and create a new sc hema for the target DB engine**
- **requires the SCT tool to be running on on-prem infra**
- **==IMP: SCT WILL NOT BE NEEDED IF SOURCE AND TARGET DB ENGINE ARE SAME==**
