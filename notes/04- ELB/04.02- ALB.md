- Layer 7(HTTP/HTTPS) - Application Layer load balancer 
- Balances load across ==multiple machines==
- **Helps in routing HTTP to HTTPS as well**
- Supports WebSocket too


## Routing 

Routing to different target groups can be based on:

1. URL paths (/admin , /student, etc)
2. URL Domain ( admin.myapp.com, users.myapp.com, etc)
3. Query Strings( ?status=admin, ?status=paidUser, etc)

## Target groups for ALB

1. EC2 Instances or ASG
2. ECS tasks
3. lambda function
4. Private IP Address

## IMP points
1. ALB will have a fixed Domain/hostname
 
	1. The ALB will include headers
		1. x-forwarded-for: the client IP
		2. x-forwarded-port: port used by client
		3. x-forwarded-proto: protocol use
