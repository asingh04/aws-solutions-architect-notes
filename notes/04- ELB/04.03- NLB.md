# Network Load Balancer


- Layer 4 (Network) based LB
- Uses TCP / UDP protocol for routing
- ==Highly performant compared to ALB==
- ==NLB will have only 1 static IP per AZ== not hostname like ALB
- supports assigning elastic IP as well
- Health checks: **HTTP, HTTPS AND TCP**
- 


## Target groups
1. EC2 instances or ASGs
2. Private IP address
3. ALB



## IMP

- If you **specify targets using an instance ID**, 
- traffic is routed to instances using the **primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface**
- The **load balancer rewrites the destination IP address** from the data packet before forwarding it to the target instance.
