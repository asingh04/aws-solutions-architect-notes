# Kinesis vs SQS FIFO


- SQS FIFO can have partitioning/shards as well using `GroupID`.
- Each `gourpID` will have it's own partitioning.
- **There is no limit on number of partitioning or shards in the SQS FIFO**
- SO if a consumer can scale up to handle large no of messages
	- SQS FIFO can scale up the partitioning to infinite number.
- but **SQS FIFO is not Real Time nor Near Real Time.**


- Kinesis will have a max limit on number of partitioning, provisioned at the time of creation
- Kinesis provides Real Time and Real Time Capabilities.
