# KDS - Kinesis Data Stream


## Shards

- Shards are like **partitions** of the data stream
- **No of shards needs to be provisioned ahead of time** <-- ==IMP==

## Producers

- Any application which can use
	- AWS SDK, KPL
	- Kinesis Agent
- Mobile or computer device
- ==Max throughput is **1 MB/s or 1000 records/s per shard**== <--- IMP
- 


## Producer Record

- This is what is pushed into shard
- Contains:
	- **Partition Key** - defines in which shard data will go to
	- **Data Blob** - max 1MB size <--- ==IMP==


## Consumers

- Any application running
	- SDK or KCL
	- Lambda function
	- KDF
	- KDA
- Throughput is of 2 types:
	- **Standard** - 2 MB/s ==per shard across all the consumers==
	- **Enhanced** - 2 MB/s ==per shard per consumer==

## Consumer Record

- This is what a consumer receives
- Contains:
	- **Partition Key** - defines from which partition/shard the record came from
	- **Sequence No** - defines where the record was in the partition/shard
	- **Data Blob** - same as in producer's **data blob**

## Other Important Features

- data/record once pushed in KDS can not be deleted
- record can persist from 1 day to 365 days
- Ability to reprocess/replay the data
