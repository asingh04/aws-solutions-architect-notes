# EventBridge

- Can do multiple things, like
- **Schedule Cron jobs/tasks**
- **Define event rule** to react to certain events occurring across AWS account
- Some sample sources of events could be
	- S3
	- Crontab
	- EC2 instance
	- **CloudTrail** <-- **powerful combo to intercept and react to any API call in AWS**
- Allows **filtering on the events as well** (i.e matching based on certain attributes' values) to react to
- Can trigger:
	- Compute Platforms: Lambda, ECS task
	- Integration: SNS/SQS/KDS/StepFunc
	- EC2 Actions: START/STOP/REBOOT/etc

## Event Buses

### Default Event Bus
- EventBridge uses the **"Default Event Bus"** to capture+transmit the events in an AWS account

### Partner Event Bus

- events from 3rd party applications (**Zendesk, DataDog**) can also be captured on a separate **Partner Event Bus**
- enabled EventBridge to react to external events as well

### Custom Event Bus

- events from on-prem applications can be cpatured on a custom defined event bus as well

- **IMP: EVents from different AWS account can be captured as well using resource based policies**

## Resource Based Policies

- IAM permissions on the event bus can be defined on event bus
- **helps to aggregate event from different AWS acocunt into a central account**
- 



## Events

- events can be archived: either all or filtered events
- retention period can be indefinite or TTL period
- archived  events can be replayed
