# AWS Config

- audits the AWS service and records their compliance in an AWS Account
- helps to capture the configuration changes on the resources 
- If any rule on AWS config is broken, you can setup a SNS topic to receive notification
- **Region based service**
- AWS Config can be aggregated from different regions

## Major Questions/Situations that can be solved by AWS Config

- Unrestricted SSH access to EC2 instances
- S3 buckets having public access
- ALB configuration changed over the time

## Using with S3 and Athena

- configuration data and changes information can be store in S3
- Later on you can use Athena for analysis


## Config Rules

- AWS provides some readily available **managed rules (over 75)** 
- **Custom rules can be defined as well**
	- *Required to be define on **AWS Lambda***
	- **eg:** each ebs disk will be of type gp2
- Rules can be evaluated/triggered/checked by:
	- **each config change in the account**
	- a regular time interval(crontab)
- **==IMP: CONFIG RULE ONLY TRIGGER NOTIFICATION/EVENTS, THEY DONT PREVENT THE CHANGES==**

# Config Rules Remediation

- Non-compliant resources identified by AWS Config can be fixed by **SSM Automation Document**
- retries are possible if the automation action doesn't fix the resource(**upto 5 times**)

# AWS Config Events

- Config Events can be **consumed by EventBridge**
	- A rule can be setup on eventBridge to trigger any consuming service you want
- **SNS can also consume the events directly from AWS Config**
