# CloudWatch Insights

- Just like **CloudWatch Log Insights**, there are several other insight tools available:



## CloudWatch Container Insights

- helps to **collect, aggregate and summarise logs and metrics from containers**
	- ECS tasks
	- EKS instances
	- K8s in EC2
	- Fargate
- In EKS and K8s in EC2 versions, CloudWatch Container Insights uses **a container version of CloudWatch Agent to discover containers**


## CloudWatch Lambda Insights

- helps to **collect, aggregate and summarise logs and metrics from serverless functions**
- **The Agent runs as a Lambda Layer under your function**


## CloudWatch Contributor Insights

- helps to analyze and process log data to **summarize contributor data**
	- identify top N-contributors in the system/application
	- identify which actor is having most influence or impact on the system
- Logs from any AWS service can be used for this
- eg:
	- **identify bad or malicious hosts/IPs**
	- **URLS that generate most errors**


## CloudWatch Application Insights

- provides automated dashboards over applications
- highlights potential issues in the system
- works with most AWS services: Ec2, ECS, Lambda, SQS, SNS, S3 Bucket,
- Uses AWS SageMaker
- helps to identify and fix issues pro-actively
