# CloudTrail Insight

- helps to detect unusual activity in the AWS account, examples:
	- incorrect/inaccurate resource provisioning
	- burst in IAM operations
	- hitting service limits/throttling frequently
- CloudTrail will ananlyse the normal management events to make a benchmark
- **Then it continuously analyses the WRITE Management Events and compare it with the benchmark**
- Once a anomaly is detected, **the CloudWatch Insight Event is generated**
- This event can be consumed by 
	- S3 Bucket - for Athena Analysis
	- CloudTrail COnsole
	- EventBridge rule
