- a network drive that can be attached to an EC2 instance while it runs.
- EBS <u>allows data to be persisted even after EC2 instance is terminated</u>
- **specific to an AZ**   <-- 
- <u> 1 EBS can only be attached to 1 EC2 only</u>
- <u> 1 EC2 instance can have multiple EBS volumes attached</u>
- 

CONS:
- network drive, so there will be a little latency
- Can be attached to a EC2 instance in the same AZ only

PROS
- easy for failover:
	- Can be de-attached and re-attached to a diff EC2 instance
