# Scaling Cooldown

- After a scaling activity, ASG goes into a ==Cooldown period==
- During this, ASG **will not launch or terminate** any instance

**IMP NOTE**
To use shorter cooldown period and quickly the new instances start serving requests, ==use AMI images that have most config ready to install and use.==
