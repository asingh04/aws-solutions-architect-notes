# Auto Scaling Group

- dynamically scale up or down instances based certain factors
- **EC2 health Checks**
	- => ASG can rely on EC2 based Health Checks as well
	- **eg**:
		- Checks that the instance is running.
		- Checks for underlying hardware or software issues that might impair the instance.
- ==ASG is free, charges only EC2 instances==


## Pairing with ELB

- Any instance created by ASG can be linked to a ELB automatically.
- ELB can use **Health Checks** on instances in ASG to identify and remove unhealthy instances

## Launch Template

- Contains EC2 configuration used to create new instances lilke AMI, Instance type, user data, SG, IAM roles, etc
