# ASG Scaling Policies


1. **Dynamic Scaling**
	1. Target Tracking Scaling
		- **eg**: Average CPU utilization should be ~40%
	2. Simple / Step Scaling
		- Specify when to scale up or scale down
		- **Eg:** When CPU utilization hits > 70%, scale up 2 units
2. **Scheduled Scaling**
	- Anticipate scaling needs based on usage patterns
	- **Eg:** Scale upto 10 units between 2pm to 5pm
3. **Predictive Scaling**
	- continuously forecast the usage patterns
	- 

## Metrics Used for Scaling

1. **CPU Utilization** - across all instances
2. **Request Count per target** -  no of requests being served per instance 
3. **Average Network In/Out** - based on inbound/outbound network traffic
